Lossless text compression via Huffman encoding.

Use `python compress.py encode filename.txt` to encode and compress a file.

Use `python compress.py decode filename.txt` to decode a compressed file into its original readable state.

Ensure that the file you are encoding or decoding is in the same directory as `compress.py`.
